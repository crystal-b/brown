            <p>In October 1940 the  Dutch painter Piet  Mondrian (1872&ndash;1944)   arrived in New York,  a fugitive  from  war&ndash;torn   Europe. He spent his  first  few  months in  the city  picking up contacts he  had   made earlier   with American   artists, dealers   and  critics. He also  busied   himself   completing unfinished canvases that  he  had  brought with him to the United   States. But  in  1942&ndash;3   he suddenly embarked   on  two  entirely new  and very large  pictures   that  must  have surprised   even those   friends and   collectors   already familiar with his work. Entitled <em><a href="img/Van_Doesburg_Lange_House_Stained_Glass.jpg" class="lightbox-trigger">Broadway Boogie&ndash;Woogie</a></em> (pl. 15???) and <em>Victory Boogie&ndash;Woogie</em>, these paintings   are in striking   contrast to any he  had created   so  far.<span class="endnote">01???</span> True,   their compositional    structure   was  still  dominated by  the same horizontal and  vertical  axes that  had constituted   the  basis  of his  art  since  the early  1920s.  Gone, however, were  the dominant   black  lines whose  cage&ndash;like  grid  had  imprisoned planes   of  primary   colour,  allowing  any  possibility   of  escape only at the very edges  of the canvas. Now colour  itself  forms lines,  mostly yellow, running   joyfully across the picture   surface  as if exulting in  its  new-found freedom,  while some  of  the  spaces between the lines  are also  occupied   by larger coloured planes.<span class="endnote">02???</span> At  the  same time,  the  lines  themselves   are constantly punctuated    by smaller  rectangles   of red,  blue  and grey&ndash;white. These set up  their  own contrasting rhythm, conveying  an  impression   of irregular,   syncopated movement. The effect is dynamic, exhilarating,   even  a little  bewildering.</p>

            <p>Mondrian's friend   Charmion    von  Wiegand,    who knew   him well during   the last years   of his  life,  remembered     the artist being 'terrifically impressed by  the  dynamism he  found in  New York'  and that he  'wanted   to make his  paintings   more  dynamic'.   She  also  recalled that Mondrian's    earlier works now appeared to him 'too  classically  balanced   once he looked  at  them with  American   eyes'.<span class="endnote">03???</span> Her remarks   are to  the point. The   impression created by <em>Broadway Boogie&ndash;Woogie</em> and <em>Victory Boogie&ndash;Woogie</em> is certainly   quite  different   from that produced by  Mondrian's abstract    colour   compositions    of the 1920s and  1930s,  nearly all of  which  convey  a  feeling  of  repose  or  equilibrium.   Whether   we  are really meant to associate   his later paintings   with the  grid&ndash;like  pattern   of Manhattan's    streets, the windows  of skyscrapers   and the  lights  of moving  automobiles,   as  many  commentators have suggested,   is another question. Whatever   else  they  might be, the  pictures   were  obviously not intended as some  kind  of  street  map  or  aerial  view  of New  York, least of all <em>Broadway  Boogie&ndash;Woogie</em>. As  Mona Hadler   has emphasized, Broadway is the  one  diagonal  that  contradicts   the  otherwise  relentless   grid  pattern   of midtown   Manhattan's    streets,   a  disruptive   element   of  which   there   is no  trace in  Mondrian's painting.<span class="endnote">04???</span> On  the  other  hand,   there   is  no  denying  that   these works  are  far  busier,  far  more  expressive   of  movement    and  dynamism   than any  of  his  earlier  pictures,   as if the artist  were  seeking  to  express  in  abstract pictorial  form  something   of the  frenetic,  pulsating   life of the  modern city.</p>

            <p>At   the   same   time,   the   irregular,    constantly     shifting   patterns    of squares   and rectangles call  irresistibly   to  mind   the  infectious,   syncopated rhythms   of  jazz. This   association   is  rendered   all  the  more  plausible by  the titles  given  to  these  two  late  paintings,   although the titles  too  are  somewhat startling when considered within the verall context of Mondrian's pictorial oeuvre. Nearly all his works  f the preceding two decades had been identified by names that are, in a sense, as unrevealing as possible, alluding to nothing outside of the picture itself. A typical Mondrian title would consist  just  of the word 'Composition' followed by a letter, a number or a listing of the colours employed: for example, his abstract&ndash;geometric <em>Composition No. I</em> of 1925 also known as <em>Composition with Blue and Yellow</em>. Admittedly, the more specific names given to some of the pictures he painted in America, such as the series <em>New York City I &ndash; III</em>, do have an immediate precedent in other 'urban' paintings begun shortly before his departure from Europe: <em>Place de la Concorde</em>, which he started in Paris in  1938, or <em>Trafalgar  Square</em>, the product of his   stay in London the following year. But the only antecedents for the <em>Boogie&ndash;Woogie</em> paintings, highly unusual among Mondrian's works inasmuch as they allude so  specifically  to another art form, are two canvases now owned by Yale University  Art  Gallery entitled <em>Composition No. III, Fox&ndash;Trot B, with Black, Red, Blue and Yellow</em> (1929      Â· fig. 88???) and <em>Composition No. IV 1929/Fox&ndash;Trot A: Lozenge with Three Lines</em> (1929&ndash;30).<span class="endnote">05???</span></p>

            <p>These two work  &mdash; or rather,  their  titles &mdash; alert the viewer  to Mondrian's lifelong interest in music  and especially popular music, a  topic that crops up repeatedly in essays  written at intervals throughout his career. He discussed questions to do with  jazz and its relation to visual culture on several  occasions: for example, in his essays 'Neo&ndash;Plasticism: its Realization in Music  and Future Theatre' of 1922 and 'Jazz  and  Neo&ndash;Plastic' of 1927.<span class="endnote">06???</span> He  also analyzed at some length the significance of Luigi Russolo's 'noise intoners', and of sounds and noises generally, in a two&ndash;part article published in the magazine <em>De Stijl</em> in August and September 1921.<span class="endnote">07???</span> This article  was a response to a Futurist concert he had heard at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre des ChampsÂ­&ndash;&Eacute;lys&eacute;es in Paris, one of three performances given on 17, 20 and 24 June 1921, which had involved a large battery of <em>intonarumori</em> as well as an orchestra made up of more conventional instruments.<span class="endnote">08???</span> Press coverage reveals that these events were disrupted by noisy disturbances staged by Parisian Dadaists, with Andre Breton at their head. However, Mondrian's earliest extended discussion of music had already appeared in print the year before as part of a long and important essay entitled <em>Neo&ndash;Plasiicism: the General Principle of Plastic Equivalence</em>.<span class="endnote">09???</span></p>

            <p>As its title suggests, Mondrian's essay on Neo&ndash;Plasticism is couched in highly abstract and at times even mystically tinged language. Much of it is taken up by a wide&ndash;ranging account of his philosophy of art: in particular, his deeply held conviction that the purpose of all the arts was to mirror the harÂ­mony and equilibrium that underlay the chance appearances of nature. But having reviewed the latest achievements of contemporary painting, sculpture and architecture, towards the end of that more general discussion he turned his attention to other art forms including poetry and music. In Mondrian's eyes, one of the defining characteristics of the new music was a polar opposiÂ­tion between melody and harmony, melody being characterized as 'descripÂ­tive' and 'emotional', harmony as 'orderly' and 'objective'. He writes about how the music of the past had mainly consisted of a 'confusion of the active and the passive' and about how what he termed the 'constructive plastic' was all too often 'veiled by descriptive melody'. The next and most urgent goal, Mondrian concluded, should be the 'demolition of melody': a task already being undertaken, albeit 'somewhat brutally', by the jazz band with its 'dry, unfamiliar, strange noises that oppose rounded sound'.<span class="endnote">10???</span> Just as important in this context was music's rhythmic aspect. In his article about Russolo's noise machines, Mondrian wrote that 'as soon as composition dominates, the rhythm becomes more absolute and the expression far more universal, as in olden times eg in fugues by Bach or in our own day in van Domseiaer's <em>Experiments in Style</em>'.<span class="endnote">11???</span></p>

            <p>Today, Mondrian's allusion to the Dutch composer Jakob van Domselaer (1890&ndash;1960) requires some unpicking, given that the latter ultiÂ­mately made little impact on the history of twentieth-century music. The two men first met in the autumn of 1912 and soon became close friends. As their relationship developed, it became apparent that they had a good deal in common: for example, their shared enthusiasm for the mystical mathematics propounded by the Dutch theosophist and teacher M. H. J. Schoenmaekers, whose book <em>The New Image of the World</em> (1915) was one of Mondrian's most cherished possessions. In a letter dated February 1916, the artist Theo van Doesburg (1883&ndash;1931) remarked on the fact that both Mondrian and van Domselaer appeared to be 'in the grip' of Schoenmaekers' theories.<span class="endnote">12???</span> They remained in contact until at least 1916, the year of van Domselaer's marriage, when the latter published a group of seven piano pieces entitled <em>Proeven van Stijlkunst</em> &mdash; the <em>Experiments in Style</em> that Mondrian refers to. One can only a sume that his friendship with van Domselaer caused Mondrian to start taking a closer interest in questions to do with contemporary music and with possible relationships between music and visual art. Certainly, in his essay on Neo-Plasticism he sought to relate van Domselaer's music to his own ideas about balance and harmony. He also wrote that in his  opinion the composer's work showed the beginnings of a 'neutralizing opposition' between descriptive melody and 'another colour, less natural, another rhythm, more abstract'.<span class="endnote">13???</span></p>

            <p>For his part, van Domselaer told Mondrian's friend, biographer and fellow painter Michel Seuphor (1901-1999), that he had tried to 'transÂ­late into music my impression of Mondrian, both the man and his works'. According to Seuphor, van Domselaer had specifically asked that his <em>Proeven van Stijlkunst</em> should be 'played in such a way that the static element ... be accentuated, while the movement (or the melody) remains peaceful and flowing'.<span class="endnote">14???</span> In striving for a balance between harmony and melody, he must have felt  that he was creating a musical equivalent of paintings by Mondrian which, even as early as 1916, were already dominated by careÂ­fully calculated juxtapositions of horizontal and vertical elements. Van Domselaer also stressed the idea that the melodic aspect of music should yield its traditionally dominant role to rhythm, an obvious point of contact with ideas advanced not only by Mondrian but also by van Doesburg. TogethÂ­er, these two were the major painters, theorists and co&ndash;founders of <em>De Stijl</em>.<span class="endnote">15???</span></p>

            <p>As for Mondrian, he may have been responding co ideas about music already current among artists of the <em>De Stijl</em> circle. He may even have been influenced by van Doesburg who, as Nancy Troy has pointed out, had been painting 'musical' pictures and drawing comparisons with music for some time before Mondrian first used musical titles or publicly expressed an interest in the subject. In fact, van Doesburg's <em>Rhythm of a Russian Dance</em> (1918;  see pl. <span class="endnote">16???</span>), in which rhythm and movement are reduced to a  play of horizontal and vertical lines, precedes Mondrian's first known mention of dance or discussion of music in his own writings by about two years.<span class="endnote">17???</span> Between 1919 and 1921, van Doesburg also sought to apply ideas about music to the fields of architecture and applied art, proposing the use of 'triads' of primary and secondary colours in designs he made for the decoration of buildings by the architect J.J.P. Oud (1890&ndash;1963). And in his colour schemes for  a residential block and agricultural school in the small Frisian town of Drachten, van Doesburg suggested applying musical proportions to the distribution of colours in the ratio eight parts blue to five parts red to three parts yellow, corresponding to the first inversion of a major triad: the eighth, fifth and third notes of the scale.<span class="endnote">17???</span> Again there are points of contact with ideas later advanced by Mondrian, who wrote in his essay on Neo&ndash;Plasticism in music and theatre of 1922 about the relationship between sounds and colours:</p>

            <div class="blockquote"><p><strong>Both sound and noise will be manifested as Jundamencal sound and fundamental nonsound, like colour and noncolour ... in Neo&ndash;Plastic painting. Their number will be determined by practice: probably three sounds and three nonsounds ( as in paintÂ­ing: red, blue,yellow; white, black gray).</strong><span class="endnote">18???</span></p></div>

          <div class="small-12 large-7 columns">
            <p>A more famous example of van Doesburg applying musical principles to visual art can be found in his designs for a stained&ndash;glass  window for the de Lange house in Alkmaar, Holland (1917; fig.89???). This window is in effect an abstract colour composition in three parts, the flanking sections of which are mirror images of one another. The upper half of each of these side windows is both a repetition and, at the same time, an inversion of the lower part, as if a vertical piece of paper had been first divided in  two  and  then folded downwards  upon  itself. By contrast, the  upper half of the central window is simply an upside&ndash;down version of the  lower half, like turning a  piece of paper the wrong way up. Individual parts  of each window likewise form patÂ­terns that are repeated upside down or back to front. As many commentators have remarked, these  compositional  devices  might be considered the visual counterpart of the  thematic inversions and instances of retrograde motion found in a typical Bach fugue, as described in Chapter 5. Like Mondrian, van Doesburg willingly acknowledged Bach's mastery of musical form: for examÂ­ple, when he wrote:</p>

            <div class="blockquote"><strong><p>Music has advanced further than painting as regards its means of expression. In music  &mdash; e.g. that of Bach &mdash; the idea of unity or harmony is directly translated into musical relationships, transformed into sounds and measures: that is, with the help of musical means of expression and nothing else.</p>

            <p>If some other element were to intrude into the music, e.g. a repeating melody or the use of a particular instrument in order to imitate some aspect of nature, that would no longer constitute absolute music.</p>

            <p>Exactly the same principle can be applied to the other arts.<span class="endnote">18???</span></p></strong></div>







            <p>Van Doesburg's and also Mondrian's emphasis on  the  vertical as opposed to the horizontal aspect  of  music - that  is, on harmony rather  than melÂ­ody -probably owed a good deal  to  a  book on contemporary music by the theoretician Paul Bekker entitled Neue  Musik, published in  1919.20 Van  Does burg's article 'Notes on the New Music',  published  in De Stijl in November the same year, is both a review and a useful summary of the ideas contained in Bekker's treatise. Bekker identifies two opposing tendencies in modern music, the first being the exploitation of quarter tones or other smallÂ­er  intervals, resulting in  an ever-greater emphasis on melody. The second tendency, which involves the use of larger intervals including the whole-tone scale such as we find in  the works of Debussy, underlines music's harmonic aspect at the expense of melody. Regarding the latter, Bekker writes that the  distinguishing characteristic of this sort of music is that it is 'fundamenÂ­tally unrnelodic'. Elsewhere, he observes that the emphasis on the harmonic aspect corresponds to a 'predominantly vertical way of experiencing music'. 2' But van Doesburg did not content himself with merely summarizing Bekker's ideas. He went much further, seeking to relate them to the broader question of music's relationship to the visual arts and to the development of present-day culture and of mankind generally. He commented on the fact that, in his eyes, an increased emphasis on the harmonic aspect of contempoÂ­rary  music is  'neither an impoverishment of our melodic way of feeling nor a narrowing of music's means of creative expre sion; rather, it is  the necesÂ­sary consequence of the  development  from the melodic to  the harmonic taking place within our own selves.' He also discussed what he considÂ­ered to be the 'ornamental' aspect of Classical and Romantic music, which had depended largely on melody, comparing the turn away from melody in modern music to the tendency towards abstraction in contemporary visual art:</p>

            <div class="blockquote"><p><strong>What  corresponds  to the abandonÂ­ment of the appearance of natural form in painting is the abandonment of melody in contemporary music ...This correspondence wich painting is all the more apposite, inasmuch as we may regard the melodic aspect of older music as the individual, as opposed to the harmonic aspect of the new music, which is universal.</strong></p></div>

            <p>In the same context, van Doesburg pointed to the contrast between the exaggerated chromaticism of older, melodic or 'Romantic' music and the use of 'primary, simple tones' in modern music, which he compared to the new painting with its concentration on primary colours.<span class="endnote">22???</span></p>

            <p>Mondrian undoubtedly shared many of these ideas about the relaÂ­tionship between music and visual art. He may even have taken a hand in formulating some of them. But as far as his own personal tastes were concerned, he was clearly not a great admirer of the latest trends in serious music. He may have met Arthur Honegger  (1892-1955) in Paris, where he also briefly made the acquaintance of Edgard Varese (1883-1965). And he could scarcely have been unaware of the rhythmic innovations that characterized Stravinsky's recent works. But he took little trouble to pursue such acquaintances and rarely mentioned these or other contemporary composÂ­ers. Moreover, he soon came to regard van Domselaer's later music as being excessively melodic, despite his initial enthusiasm for the latter's Stijlproeve11. His real passion, attested to by numerous anecdotes as well as by his own statements, was for jazz and dance  music.  Michel  Seuphor, who knew him well in Paris  during  the  1920s,  wrote more than once about Mondrian's passion for dancing and remembered their going together to see the Revue Negre at the Theatre des Champs-Elysees. He also described how in 1929 the artist visited the circus on  the Avenue Wagram every night for two whole weeks simply in order to hear the jazz band that played in the twentyÂ­minute interval.</p>

            <p>When Mondrian arrived in New York in October 1940, the city was in the grip of a jazz revival, one important element of which was the craze for boogie-woogie, a musical fashion imported from Chicago but which by then had also conquered New York. He seems to have responded with great intensity to this new musical environment. One of his first  acquisitions  on moving into his Manhattan studio was  a  gramophone on which  he could play the latest jazz records. One should not underestimate the extraordinary influence that the gramophone exerted on artists at this time, coupled with the availability of an ever-greater variety of recorded music. It has even been suggested that the American painter Arthur Dove painted two pictures with the same title but of contrasting character, his Rhapsody in Blue Part I and II, simply because the recording of George Gershwin's (1898-1937) Rhapsody in Blue that he owned extended over two sides of a 78-rpm record, the first side being occupied by the opening allegro, the second by the finale.,. Friends of Mondrian like Harry Holtzman also recalled accompanying the artist to wellÂ­known jazz clubs like the  Cafe  Society  Downtown, where they  could enjoy the latest hits. '5 Mondrian, who at the age of nearly seventy must have been apprehensive about starting a  new life in America, was clearly delighted at finding himself in  a sympathetic milieu in which other artists were respondÂ­ing just  as enthusiastically to popular music. When, shortly after his arrival, he met the painter  Stuart Davis (1892-1964), one of the first  things  they talked about was their shared passion for jazz, while Davis's wife, who someÂ­times partnered Mondrian on the dance floor, commented approvingly on the latter's ability as a dancer.<span class="endnote">26???</span></p>

            <p>According to Davis, Mondrian was quick  to pronounce certain examples of boogie-woogie to be 'Pure' or 'The True Jazz'. As for the rest, it was 'worthy, provided an inferior status be granted' .'7 And in an interview in 1943  with James Johnson Sweeney, who was to organize the first big memoÂ­rial exhibition following the painter's death in 1944, Mondrian declared:</p>

            <div class="blockquote"><p><strong>True  Boogie-Wvogie  I conceive  as homogeneous in  intention  with  mine  in paintÂ­ing: destruction of melody,  which  is  the  equivalent of the  destruction  of natural appearance, and construction  through  the  continuous  opposition  of pure  means -dynamic rhythm.</strong><span class="endnote">28???</span></p></div>

            <p>Although Mondrian is talking about his new-found passion  for  boogieÂ­woogie, the points he makes convey the same ideas that can be found in his earlier essays: that harmony (here referred to as 'construction') consists in the reconciliation of polar opposites, that music and visual art must serve the same  ends, and that rhythm is to be equated with the 'abstract' element in music. Melody, considered 'descriptive', was  by contrast too  closely linked with emotion and thus with music's subjective aspect. Its equivalent in paintÂ­ing lay in the mistaken attempt to capture the outward appearance of nature, whereas the real task of art was to  'create unity ... to follow  not  nature's aspect but what nature really is'.'9 Hence the 'destruction of melody', which Mondrian considered to be the particular achievement of jazz, had its counÂ­terpart in the 'destruction of natural appearance'.</p>

            <p>For many Europeans visiting the United States, jazz -no matter in what form they encountered it - was  an especially vivid aspect of their American experience. Among those visitors were artists and composÂ­ers like Francis Picabia or Darius Milhaud, who translated the infectious rhythms and colourful timbres of jazz into their own pictorial or musical language. Milhaud recalled nostalgically the jazz ensemble he had heard in Harlem in 1922 and pointed out that he had used the same combinaÂ­tion of seventeen solo instruments in his score for the ballet <em>La Creation du Monde</em>, which he described as 'providing the opportunity I had been waiting for to use those elements of jazz to which I had devoted so much study'.30 Even earlier, responding to the sights and sounds of New York, both Man Ray (1890-1976) and Albert Gleiizes (1881-1953) had produced visual images to which they gave the title Jazz: the former an airbrushed abstraction of 1919, the latter a more obviously figurative depiction of the same subject painted in 1915.<span class="endnote">31???</span></p>

            <p>American artists, too, responded enthusiastically to contemporary popular music. As mentioned earlier, the painter Stuart Davis shared Mondrian's passion  for jazz, which exerted a profound influence on his thinking not just about music but also about art. Davis bad been captivated by jazz at an early point in his career, describing it as 'a continuous source of inspiraÂ­tion in my work ... for the simple reason that I regard it as one American art which seemed to me to have the same quality of art that I found in the best European painting.'32 For him, however, it was not just a question of quality nor even one of simply turning to music as a source of inspiration. Instead, he believed that visual art could usefully emulate the formal qualities of this new kind of music. He encouraged other artists to study jazz closely in an effort to  attain a comparable degree of rhythmic variety in painting, advisÂ­ing Romare Bearden (19n-1988), for example, to listen to the freedom that characterized Earl Hines's piano playing.</p>

            <p>But  Davis  was  also conscious of the  fact  that  beneath  that freeÂ­dom could be found an underlying order. Writing in 1922 about points of resemblance between painting and jazz, he emphasized the way in which one particularly dominant element in a picture could make 'lack of order seem orderly in other elements, just as in a jazz band the powerful rhythm holds together the most unrelated excursions  of the individual pieces'.31 He even envisaged a parallel between the constituent elements of music and those of painting, pointing to affinities between the 'tonal intervals of music' and what he saw as their counterpart in painting: 'intervals of tone, colour, contrast, size and direction'. In the same vein, discussing the large mural he painted in 1939 for  Studio  B  of the New York radio station WNYC  (fig. 90???),  he described it as:</p>

            <div class="blockquote"><p><strong>a harmonious design of shape, color and direction . . . a visual decoration which creates a mood in the spectator, just as a piece of music creates a mood, instead of giving some kind off actual information or instruction.</strong><span class="endnote">34???</span></p></div>
